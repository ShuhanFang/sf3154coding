            <P>
                "Color activity house" is a work in which colored glass walls in the three primary colors of cyan, magenta, and yellow form a spiral pavilion centered on a single point. Areas of light blend according to the viewing location and the movement of the viewer, creating chance encounters between people and landscapes through different colors. The sight of people passing between glass and plazas reflected in the glass creates a new spectacle in the familiar city. There is a light source in the center that glows like a colored lighthouse from sunset to dawn.

            <P><strong>ABOUT THE ARTWORK</strong></P>
            <P>In one of the museum’s courtyards is a swimming pool framed by a limestone deck. When viewed from the deck, the pool appears to be filled with deep, shimmering water. In fact, however, a layer of water only some 10cm deep is suspended over transparent glass. Below the glass is an empty space with aquamarine walls that viewers can enter. The work sets up an unfolding sequence of experiences, from our astonishment at peering down and finding people under the water to our gazing upward from the interior of the pool. While undermining our everyday assumptions about what we think to be obvious, the work invites our active involvement in its spaces—once we catch on to its deception—and produces a sense of connection between people looking at each other.</P>

            <P><strong>ABOUT THE ARTWORK</strong></P>
            <P>A large black oval is seen on a slanted concrete slab forming one wall of the gallery. The black oval looks flat, but it also appears like a round prominence. The harder we stare at it, the more the truth of the oval’s appearance eludes us. The oval is in fact a large hole, its interior covered with blue pigment. Using a simple shape and materials, the work undermines our perception and plunges us into thought. The title, L’Origine du monde (“The Origin of the World”) refers to a work of the same title by the 19th-century French painter, Gustave COURBET.</P>

            <P><strong>ABOUT THE ARTWORK</strong></P>
            <P>This work was inspired by Birdman of Alcatraz (1961, USA), a film based on the true story of a man who kept birds in his cell while imprisoned in solitary confinement and became an ornithologist. At the film’s end, when the man, who has been denied permission to continue his research, is asked about his future plans, he replies: “I am going to measure the clouds.” The artwork takes its title from this line. Although modeled after the artist himself, The Man Who Measures the Clouds also pays homage to his late twin brother. It is thus a work blending various elements—human life and death, natural science, and the poetic gesture of “measuring the clouds.”</P>

            <P><strong>ABOUT THE ARTWORK</strong></P>
            <P>Green Bridge is created so as to bridge over a glass corridor. Plants of many varieties are arranged in a superb aesthetic balance, pleasing to see in all four seasons. In summer, there are Japanese snowflowers and irises; in spring, plaintain lilies and hydrangea; in autumn, flowered branches of Japanese bush clover; and in winter, Japanese silverleaf blossoms. Planted on both sides of a wall just 14cm thick are some 100 plant varieties suited to Kanazawa’s climate. The wall’s north and south sides receive different amounts of sunlight each day, so plants suitable to the growing conditions on each side have been selected, thus giving the work a different appearance on each side. Botanist Patrick Blanc’s theory that plants can grow even under limited conditions has found expression in a work of art.</P>

            <P>This pavilion, established on the lawn encompassing the museum, is contrived to let children enter and play in the interior. It takes a complex shape, reminiscent of a balloon pushed out in six different directions from the inside. Three of the six projections contact the ground at their ends and support the overall structure while functioning as entrances. By giving the pavilion transparency using pipes and wire mesh, the architect has produced an image of lightness that renders the structure’s large size unnoticeable.</P>
